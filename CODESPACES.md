# Developing in Codespaces / DevContainer

Looks like you have opened this project in GitHub Codespaces or a Dev Container.
Here are some important things you should be aware of:

1. **Ready Environment & Auto-Configuration**: The environment is pre-configured
   there is no need for any manual setup. Newly created codespaces will
   automatically run initialization tasks. If you see a message like the one below
   wait for the setup completion before running tests or making commits.

   ```
   Finishing up
   Running postStartCommand
   .devcontainer/post_start.sh
   ```

2. **Pre-configured VS Code Extensions**: This setup pre-installs some VSCode
   extensions for you, but some may need a window refresh to activate. If your
   sidebar extensions icon looking like the one below, click on it to check the
   messages:

   ![Extensions loading](images/vscode_extension_attention_needed.png)
   ![Extensions wait](images/vscode_extension_wait.png)

3. **GitHub Copilot**: We've included this, but remember it requires a
   subscription. If you're not a subscriber, you can safely ignore any error
   messages related to Copilot.

If you encounter any issues or need help, please reach out to the project maintainers.
